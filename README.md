Ohyeah is a small Go library that implements a set of functions that generate random data
and data structures, primarily intended for generating test data.

## Usage

The key abtraction in ohyeah is the `Generator`, which is a parameterless function
that produces a value:

```go
type Generator func() interface{}
```

Generators typically produce a series of randomly generated values, a new
one each time you call the function. One thing to note is that most
of the functions provided by ohyeah are not themselves generators: Instead
they are higher order functions that return generators. 
For example, the `PatternedStringGen` function returns a function
which produces a series of strings all of the form "<PAT><N>" where
<PAT> is the sring you pass to `PatternedStringGen` and <N> is an integer
that starts at 1.

Thus this:

```go
	idGen := ohyeah.PatternedStringGen("ID")
	nameGen := ohyeah.PatternedStringGen("Fred")
```

Will give you a function in `idGen` that will generated a sequence of ID strings:

```go
	a := idGen()  // a is "ID1"
	b := idGen()  // b is "ID2"

	n1 := nameGen()  // That's "Fred1"
	n2 := nameGen()  // That's "Fred2"
```

If you are not used to this style of programming, the whole function producing
a function thing may seem overly abstract, but it has a huge practical advantage:
Once you have set up your generator function -- the way we did with `idGen` and
`nameGen` above -- you no longer need to worry about what or how it is doing
it's thing. You just call the function.
 
While there isn't really much randomness coming out of `PatternedStringGen`,
many of the other ohyeah functions do and those functions all take a
random iterger generating function defined as:

```go
type Int64F func()int64
```

This function can be any function that returns a series of random int64's.
The ohyeah package supplies an higher order function to produce just
such a random function in the form of `RandomFunc`.

## Example

To make this all a bit more concrete, here is a generator that produces an 
map of strings => arrays filled with, well, _stuff_.


```go
	// Random function we will use through out.

	r := ohyeah.RandomFunc(99)

	// Generator which picks random element from the array.


	strs := []interface{}{"foo", "bar", "baz", "apple", "organge", "red", "x"}
	strs_gen := ohyeah.ElementGen(r, strs)

	// Generator which returns random ints. 

	ints_gen := ohyeah.IntGen(r)

	// Generator which always just returns true

	true_gen :=  ohyeah.ConstantGen(true)

	// Generator which returns "Key1", "Key2" ...

	key_gen := ohyeah.PatternedStringGen("Key")

	// Generator which will return values from the other generators

	value_gen := ohyeah.CycleGen(true_gen, key_gen, ints_gen, strs_gen)

	// Generator which will return randomly sized arrays of values, max len = 10

	array_gen := ohyeah.ArrayGen(r, value_gen, 10)

	// Generator which will return randomly sized maps of "KeyNNN" => array

	map_gen := ohyeah.MapGen(r, key_gen, array_gen, 10)
```
